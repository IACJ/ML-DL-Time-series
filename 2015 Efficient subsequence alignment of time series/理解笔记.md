'Making it faster (usually an order of magnitude, or no one cares). ' — Eamonn Keogh, UC Riverside

ED 和 DTW distance measures 很有用，需要高效实现。


The UCR-Suite[17], a recent approach by Rakthanmanon et al., is to our best knowledge the fastest implementation of locally z-normalized subsequence alignment under ED and DTW and thus needs further investigation.

1. Subsequence Alignment in Streams
2. Windowed z-Normalization
