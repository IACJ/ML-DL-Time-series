# Efficient Subsequence Alignment of Time Series (2015)


## 1 - Introduction


* 3 Stages of Generalizing the workflow of a typical time series data mining application（3个阶段）
    1. Find a Proper Representation
    2. Determine a Notion of Similarity
    3. Implementation of Efficient and Robust Algorithms
                                    
* Toy Dataset（数据集）
    1. Cylinder-Bell-Funnel
        - infinite number of samples
        - variable amplitudes
        - time-dependent noise
        - variable support 
        - approximate global alignment
    2. Gun-Point
        - real-world data
        - slowly-varying
        - approximate global alignment
